# Breakthrough_Game_AI_Agent

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Breakthrough Game project, a collaborative effort by Godavarthi Sai Nikhil and Anish Borkar. In this project, we have implemented an intelligent AI player using Q-Learning for the Breakthrough Gameâ€”a strategic board game that combines elements of chess and traditional war games. The project challenges players with intricate moves, pawn captures, and special maneuvers on an 8x8 square board.

## Team
- **Anish Borkar**
- **Godavarthi Sai Nikhil**

## Requirements
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Sys, IPython display
- **Development Environment:** VsCode, Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook

## Mentor
We extend our sincere gratitude to **Dr. Soharab Hossain Shaikh** for his guidance and mentorship throughout the development of our Breakthrough Game project.

## Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to create an AI player for the Breakthrough Game using Q-Learning. We aim to train the AI to make intelligent moves, strategically advancing towards the opponent's home row while considering pawn captures, special moves like en passant, and defensive strategies.

## Key Features
- **Table-Driven Approach:** We have implemented a structured decision-making process using predefined rules and strategies. This approach provides clarity in decision-making and facilitates easy scalability and modification of the AI's behavior.
- **Q-Learning:** Our intelligent agent utilizes the Q-Learning algorithm to learn and adapt its strategies based on observed rewards and penalties. This dynamic approach allows the AI to evolve over time and improve its decision-making capabilities.
- **Game Mechanics:** The project faithfully mimics the rules of the Breakthrough Game, involving pawn movement, captures, en passant moves, and an endgame focus on reaching the opponent's end of the board.

## Project Impact
Our intelligent AI player contributes to the field of reinforcement learning, showcasing adaptability and dynamic decision-making. The project includes a sensitivity analysis, providing insights into the impact of hyperparameters such as the discount factor, learning rate, and epsilon decay rate on the learning dynamics of the algorithm.
